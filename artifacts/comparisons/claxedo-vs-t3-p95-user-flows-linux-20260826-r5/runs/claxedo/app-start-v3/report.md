## Application start

| Application state | Average (ms) | Maximum (ms) | p95 (ms) | Valid / attempted |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| First launch — new application state | 4032.8 | 4307.6 | 4307.6 | 5 / 5 |
| Repeat launch — initialized application state | 4882.6 | 5147.2 | 5147.2 | 5 / 5 |

Both rows launch a new process and end at the same endpoint: the 1 MiB anchor transcript is correct and painted across two presentation opportunities, and the composer accepts trusted input. The repeat row uses a cloned state snapshot that completed exactly one earlier unmeasured launch and clean shutdown.

## Scope

This is a GUI benchmark for multi-harness coding-agent applications. It loads completed OpenCode-format historical sessions; no model, agent, stream, or embedded terminal workload runs. Web Vitals are not measured.

Latency and readiness are driver-attested. CPU and RSS are observed by the framework over driver-declared application processes. All summaries are framework-derived from preserved raw observations.
